## kettle-rb

`kettle-rb` is where I plan to stash my shaved, butchered, and boiled Yaks for Ruby Development.

I expect this list to grow over time to a handful of gems for specific contexts.

* `kettle-soup-cover` - Easily configure SimpleCov in 4 lines of code for every CI platform, and control all configurable settings with ENV variables.
